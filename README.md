# FaceRecognition
This project is a real-time Face Detection System built using Python and OpenCV. It uses the Haar Cascade Classifier to detect human faces from a webcam feed, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces. The system is lightweight, easy to run, and ideal for beginners exploring computer vision and OpenCV-basedÂ applications.
